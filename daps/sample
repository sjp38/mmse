# This file is a sample data access patterns file.  A program is constructed
# with multiple phases and each phase has unique data access pattern.  Thus, a
# data access pattern of a program can be defined as a list of data access
# patterns for its phases.
#
# Further, we define the data access pattern for each program phase as a list
# of data access pattern entries.  Each data access pattern entry is defined as
# a memory address range, access type (sequential or random; skewered will be
# supported in future), access stride, and number of accesses to the memory
# address range.
#
# This file uses a format for the data access patterns.  Lines starting with
# '#' is comments.  The comment lines are ignored while parsing.  Each line
# presents the data access pattern entry.  Consecutive data access pattern
# entry lines constitutes a data access pattern.  Data access patterns are
# sperated by one or more blank lines.
#
# For more detail, refer to 'dap.py'.
# range, seq|rnd, stride, number of accesses
